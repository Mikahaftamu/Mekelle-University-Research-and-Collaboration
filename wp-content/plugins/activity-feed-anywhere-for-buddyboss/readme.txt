Activity Feed Anywhere For BuddyBoss adds a native BuddyBoss activity post box and/or feed on any page.

== Description ==

This is a fork of the plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/activity-feed-anywhere/ by @bouncingsprout and we have their permission for this plugin.

This plugin lets you add a fully functional BuddyBoss activity stream to any page. Designed to match the native BuddyBoss activity feed, you can now post and see activity from wherever you like.

== How to use Activity Feed Anywhere For BuddyBoss ==

Simply add the shortcode \[activity_feed_anywhere_for_buddyboss\] to any page on your site.

If you would rather not display the feed, but only the 'post box', simply use \[activity_feed_anywhere_for_buddyboss feed=false \]. Activity entered here will show up in activity feeds elsewhere in the site.

If you would rather not display the post box, but only the feed itself, simply use \[activity_feed_anywhere_for_buddyboss postbox=false \].

If you want to add the shortcode with PHP in a page template, you need to use a template with a filename that includes the name "page-custom-template-with-activity-feed". For example, you can call the file "page-custom-template-with-activity-feed.php", "page-custom-template-with-activity-feed-99.php", "example-page-custom-template-with-activity-feed.php". You can use the template included in this plugin templates/activity/page-custom-template-with-activity-feed.php and override it in your theme if you want by copying the file to yourtheme/page-custom-template-with-activity-feed.php
